# Implement Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms 

A hands-on project for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms in Python. This project aims to deepen understanding of algorithms and enhance Python coding skills by implementing neural networks, decision trees, and other advanced models based on the Coursera [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction) course. 

## Description

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks with self-implemented machine learning and deep learning algorithms. While the course labs provide pre-written code, this repository focuses on implementing these algorithms independently (and more efficiently). The repository includes implementations of:
- Forward Prop with Numpy
- Decision Trees

Each notebook is structured to implement algorithms step-by-step, and test them on sample data from the course labs.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow`

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/implement-nn.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the required libraries using pip or conda, for instance:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter-notebook
   ```

### Executing Program

1. Open the cloned repository in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Select the notebook for the specific algorithm or topic you want to explore.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize results.

## Help

For troubleshooting common issues:
- If you encounter library import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.
- Jupyter Notebook may sometimes fail to start if conflicting versions of libraries are installed. Consider creating a virtual environment
